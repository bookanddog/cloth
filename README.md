cloth simulation

cloth moving under the force of gravity and wind.Interactive with a ball for it's briefness.

It's a non-qt project runing in qt IDE.But to load the .jpg image i use a qt library.Also i use a linux library to get the time ms so when runing in windows you need change it.

Up to now,we just can see form a fixed point.And i'm working on the camera of FPS or track ball contros with freeglut.But it should be done until October or November.
